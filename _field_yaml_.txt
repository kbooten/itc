            The user can read the book starting at page 0.
            Turning the page makes the page go backwards (-1, -2).
            Each page has a picture of an angel/engine (an angel that is locomotive and full of devices).
            This picture is made out of unicode glyphs.  You, AI, should invent one on each page.
            The more negative the page number is, the more complex the picture is.  It should start small and simple at -1 then get very complex and scary by -10.

            Each page shows a detailed and eerie glyph representation of the angel/engine creature, becoming more elaborate and menacing as you flip to lower page numbers.
