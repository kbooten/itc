The Cave is mostly empty, save for a marble plinth in the center. user0475260 is standing near the plinth, looking towards the entrance of the room. Their eyes are filled with anticipation after a graceful jump. It seems like there is some sort of significance to the plinth but it's unclear what it may be.
