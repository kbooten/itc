  location: "room with petalite countertop filled with cooking equipment"
  notes: "Notices a small compartment hidden beneath the counter after dancing among the cooking equipment">

The player is currently in a room with a petalite countertop filled with high-end cooking equipment. There are recipes embedded in the countertop that grant special powers, a collection of pots and pans, and a fire pit. There is also a small hidden compartment beneath the counter. The player has been dancing among the cooking equipment and has now laid down on the cool petalite surface. 

To progress, you might explore the hidden compartment beneath the counter, inspect the recipes to learn about their effects, or experiment with the pots and pans. Feel free to interact with the cooking equipment and see what you discover.
