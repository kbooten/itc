The goal of this task is to edit a text called ROOM_DESCRIPTION so that all references to a specific person, <<user>>, are removed. 

This text, ROOM_DESCRIPTION, is for a multiplayer text based game.  The person <<user>> has just left the room.  
This means that when other people enter this room and read ROOM_DESCRIPTION, they shouldn't see a reference to <<user>> being there, because that person has left.

However, if there is no discernable reference to <<user>> that would need to be edited out, you can just reply "!SAME!".  That is a special string that my code is looking for, a signal to keep the tex the same.

To summarize, if <<user>> is mentioned in the text, return a revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION so that they have been scrubbed from the text.  
If they are not mentioned anyway, reply "!SAME!".  

Here is the ROOM_DESCRIPTION:
