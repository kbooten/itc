Revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION:
name: Cave
public_description: >
  Empty except for a marble plinth in the center. user0475260 is standing near the plinth, breathing heavily after a graceful jump. Their eyes are filled with anticipation and they are gazing towards the entrance of the room. It seems like there is some sort of significance to the plinth but it's unclear what it may be.

  If you put the right object on the plinth, it will play a song.
