            The user can read the book starting at page 0.
            Turning the page makes the page go backwards (-1, -2).
            Each page has a picture of an angel/engine (an angel that is locamotive and full of devices).
            This picture is made out of unicode glyphs.  The user should see an actual unicode character image, not just a mere description of the angel/engine. 
            The more negative the page number is, the more complex the picture is.  It should start small and simple at -1 then get very complex and scary by -10.
            Again: you, the ai, should generate a unicode picture of an angel/engine and return it to them when they are reading a page of the book.
