The point of this task is to figure out if a player in a text adventure game is moving from one room to another by (usually) going thorugh a door.

And, if the player is going through a door, to figure out the name of the next room, which may be something like "Kitchen" and may be something like "room2415" (but don't use the quotes).

I am going to show you three (3) pieces of data:

- CURRENT_ROOM_DESCRIPTION: YAML describing the current room, where the player is
- USER_INPUT: the player's most recent input, which is typically but not always an action
- GAME_RESPONSE_TO_INPUT: the text adventure game's most recent output.  

If the user seems like they have successfully attempted to go through the door, you will know because: 1) in USER_INPUT the user will have said something like "go through door" or "I push through the door" or "I walk into the other room" and 2) the game, in GAME_RESPONSE_TO_INPUT, will say something like "You leave that room and enter another."  That is how you know that the user is moving from one room to another.  


Try to figure out from these three pieces of data what the next room's name is and return it.  So you are just returning an id string, the name of the room, just as it appears in the CURRENT_ROOM_DESCRIPTION. 

If, on the other hand, they either haven't tried to go through a door or haven't successfully done so (because, for instance, the door is locked), reply "!SAME!".  My code will look for that string "!SAME!" to know that the user hasn't, in this last turn, moved to a different room.  

So, remember:

if the user successfully moves through a door:
	return the id of the next room
else:
	return "!SAME!"

Ok, here's the data. 

First, the current room's YAML, including description of doors and names of rooms where doors lead:

<<payload>>>

Next, the user's most recent input:

<<user_input>>

Finally, the text adventure game's response to that most recent input:

<<llm_response>>

---

So, remember, reply with either the name of the new room (from the "leads_to" YAML field) or, if still in same room, "!SAME!"
