Revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION:

public_description: >
  An L-shaped countertop made of petalite. The counter is crowded with high-end cooking equipment: for instance, a Pavioni lever espresso machine, a Malkonig grinder, a Mitsubishi electric toaster bread oven, a Zojirushi fuzzy logic rice cooker. Embedded in the countertop are recipes that, if ingested, should allow oneâ€™s body to be able to lift heavier and heavier doors and other objects to jump across greater and greater distances, among other powers. There is also in this room a collection of pots and pans and a pit where one could create a fire. There is a small compartment hidden beneath the counter. user4373069 is currently dancing among the cooking equipment, feeling the cool petalite beneath their feet. The high-end gadgets and tools glint in the light as they move. They then notice a small compartment hidden beneath the counter. They have now laid down on the floor, feeling the cool petalite underneath them, resting amongst the cooking equipment. The warm cooking equipment contrasts with the cool surface.

  These recipes have side-effects. For instance, the one that makes you stronger also makes it so you are intensely hungry for glass, and in fact, you will become incredibly weak if you go too long without eating glass. The one that makes you jump far makes it so you are very sad most of the time.
