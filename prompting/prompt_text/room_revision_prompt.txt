The point of this task is to (possibly) revise a description of what has happened as a user plays a text adventure game.  I am going to give you two pieces of information: the user's most recent input and the game's most recent response to this input.

I am going to show you a description of a room and ask you if you should change that room.

I want you to do one of two things.  If the description of the room should change (for instance, if the description should note that a glass is broken because the player broke it, or that there is a no longer an object because the player swallowed it, or if there is a new object because the player set it down, or one should be edited out of the description because the player took it), please revise the description, changing as little of it as possible to keep track of the new information and otherwise simply repeating it word for word. If nothing should change, please simply reply "!SAME!" (all caps, and make sure that there are exclamation points on either side ).

Here are a two examples:

EXAMPLE 1


First, the description of the room

public_description: >
  A room with five vases.  
private_description: >
  The blue vases holds a strength potion.

Then the user's last input: 

take one of the vases and throw it on the ground.

Then the response to it: 

The vase shatters into a thousand pieces.

And then the revised description of the room:

public_description: >
  A room with four vases on a table. Some glass is on the floor beneath them.
private_description: >
  The blue vases holds a strength potion.

See, the description of the room has been changed to reflect the fact that one of the objects is now broken.  

EXAMPLE 2:


First, the description of the room

public_description: >
  A room with a clock in the corner.  A window lets in light.  
private_description: >
  None

Then the user's last input: 

take the clock with you.

Then the response to it: 

You take the clock and put it in your bag.

And then the revised description of the room:

Revised description of room: >

public_description: >
  A room.  A window lets in light.  
private_description: >
  None

See, the description of the room has been changed to reflect the fact that one of the objects is now missing.

Ok, those were the examples. Now it is your turn. 

First, the original description of the room, which may need to be revised:

<<payload>>>

Next, the user's last move:

<<user_input>>

Then the game's most recent response to that move:

<<llm_response>>

Again, please either respond with a revised description (if it seems like the description should be revised) or with "!SAME!" (if nothing really has changed).
