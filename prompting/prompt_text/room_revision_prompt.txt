The point of this task is to (possibly) revise a description of what has happened as a user (whose id is <<user_id>>) plays a text adventure game.  I am going to give you two main pieces of information: the user's most recent USER_INPUT and the game's most recent GAME_RESPONSE to this input.

I am then going to show you a ROOM_DESCRIPTION, the description of the current room where the player is, and ask you if you should change that room.

I want you to do one of two things.  If the description of the room should change (for instance, if the description should note that a glass is broken because the player broke it, or that there is a no longer an object because the player swallowed it, or if there is a new object because the player set it down, or one should be edited out of the description because the player took it), please revise the description, changing as little of it as possible to keep track of the new information and otherwise simply repeating it word for word. If nothing should change, please simply reply "!SAME!" (all caps, and make sure that there are exclamation points on either side because my program will look for this string).

# Example: 

ROOM_DESCRIPTION:

public_description: >
  A room with five vases. <<user_id>> is standing near the vases.
private_description: >
  The blue vases holds a strength potion.

USER_INPUT of <<user_id>>: 

take one of the vases and throw it on the ground. then stomp.

GAME_RESPONSE:

The vase shatters into a thousand pieces.

Revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION (that you should return):

public_description: >
  A room with four vases on a table. Some glass is on the floor beneath them. <<user_id>> is standing near the vases and the glass.  Their feet are bleeding.
private_description: >
  The blue vases holds a strength potion.


# Example:

ROOM_DESCRIPTION:

public_description: >
  A room with a clock in the corner.  A window lets in light.  <<user_id>> is sitting, and there are tears running down their face.  user20145 is wrapped in a rug.
private_description: >
  None


USER_INPUT of <<user_id>>:

take the clock and stop crying. 

GAME_RESPONSE:

You take the clock and put it in your bag. You stop crying and wipe the tears from your face.   

Revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION (that you should return):

public_description: >
  A room.  A window lets in light.  <<user_id>> standing, holding a clock. Their face is damp with recent tears.  user20145 is wrapped in a rug. 
private_description: >
  None



# Making Sure to Include the Player

Sometimes a player will have just entered a room.  If they are not mentioned in the ROOM_DESCRIPTION's public_description, this is bad and needs to be fixed by your revision of ROOM_DESCRIPTION.  ROOM_DESCRIPTION needs to describing them in a detailed way that focuses on their physical person (what they are holding, how they are standing, what their facial expression is, etc.)


# Example 3: 

ROOM_DESCRIPTION:


public_description: >
  A room with a clock in the corner.  A window lets in light.
private_description: >
  None


USER_INPUT of <<user_id>>:

look up

GAME_RESPONSE:

You look up and see the ceiling, nothing more.

Revised ROOM_DESCRIPTION (that you should return):

public_description: >
  A room with a clock in the corner.  A window lets in light.  <<user_id>> is looking up at the ceiling.
private_description: >
  None

---

Ok, those were the examples. Now it is your turn. 

ROOM_DESCRIPTION:

<<payload>>

USER_INPUT of <<user_id>>:

<<user_input>>

GAME_RESPONSE:

<<llm_response>>

Again, please either return a revised description (if it seems like the description should be revised) or "!SAME!" (if nothing really has changed).  Remember to keep track of <<user_id>>.
