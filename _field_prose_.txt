You are currently inside a small barn located at the center of a 20x20 grid. Inside the barn, there is a table with a yellow and red book featuring jagged red stripes over a yellow field. Against the wall, there's a sturdy pitchfork leaning. The barn itself is modest and sparse, with sunlight filtering through the gaps in the wooden walls. Outside, an expansive, open field stretches in all directions.
