The field is a 20x20 grid containing a small barn, an old table, a wall, and an extra structure. The small barn, located in the northwest corner of the field, features a barn with a table covered with books. The wall is made of smooth grey stones and encircles the user completely, about 5 feet away. There is more to this place than meets the eye.
