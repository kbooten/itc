The field is a 20x20 grid containing a small barn, a sturdy pitchfork, an intricate illustrations, and a yellow and red book. A barn with a table covered with books. You step inside and see a pitchfork leaning against the wall. On the table lies a yellow and red book with a cover: jagged red stripes over a yellow field.
