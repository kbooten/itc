You find yourself just south of the center of a sprawling, open field. The dry, cool breeze rustles the tall grasses around you. A weathered barn stands at the center of the field, its exterior peeling rapidly under the heavy acid rain. A tall, black metal wall bisects the barn from north to south, dividing the space into eastern and western halves. Near the back of the barn, on the west side of this wall, stands an old, rickety wooden table showing signs of distress, creaking and cracking under the acid rain and the strong winds. The ground inside the barn is littered with books. Among the scattered books, there's one with a cover featuring jagged red stripes over a yellow field—now carried by you. The field stretches out in uneven green patches, tufts of wildflowers breaking the monotony. The faint sounds of nature harmonize with the gentle whisper of the wind.

A green jelly cube measuring 26 feet by 26 feet by 26 feet with a texture that oscillates between ooze, slime, and jelly is positioned just outside the barn, wobbling violently under the acid rain and strong winds, its texture bubbling and warping. Inside the jelly cube resides a daunting heap of 10,000 knives of varying shapes and sizes made of alien metals. They cast a deep black shadow that stretches across the floor of the cube, as if absorbing all the light around them. The air fills with the chaotic symphony of 10,000 pieces of metal clinking and scraping against one another, muffled slightly by the cube's gelatinous confines. The sound reverberates through the barn, unsettling yet mesmerizing in its intensity. The knives shift dangerously as the jelly cube destabilizes under the acid rain and strong winds. The violent gashes you inflicted to escape have caused the knives to scatter inconsistently inside the cube. In front of the jelly cube, a tidy pile of neatly folded clothes begins to hiss slightly under the acid rain, small spots forming where the acidic droplets make contact.

Your identical twin, an identical version of yourself, stands motionless, mirroring your expression. Both of you are wearing bright orange jackets, pants, and boots, all designed to withstand the corrosive effects of the acidic rain and the unknown properties of the dark, viscous blood in the pond. The suits shimmer slightly, their vibrant hue standing out starkly against the grim surroundings. The acidic rain hisses and splatters against the fabric, but you remain protected as you prepare to delve into the depths of the foreboding pond of blood. Your twin grips an alien knife, its metallic surface glistening with an otherworldly sheen.

At the edge of the field lies a massive pond of dark, viscous blood emitting an overpowering scent of copper and sulfur mingling with the rank odor of rotted meat. The surrounding grass has turned black and putrid, unable to withstand the macabre influence of the pond’s presence. The acidic rain causes the pond to hiss and bubble violently, releasing noxious fumes. Strong gusts cause ripples and waves in the thick, viscous liquid, sending droplets of blood splattering across the surrounding area. Beneath the pond’s surface, twisted metal frames and angelic statue fragments create a macabre tableau. A small cylindrical device faintly glows among the twisted metal and machinery. Floating above the pond is a surreal mind cage, now disassembled, its iridescent glow dissipated into the surroundings. The serial killer, an ominous figure named Keldryn, now liberated from the mind cage, steps forward, his presence exuding a malevolence, amplified by the pulsating energy that was once contained within the cage.

Now towering just to the south is an ominous tower made of black metal that absorbs the light of the clustered moons. The structure stands at an imposing height, with a twisted, angular design and an oily, shimmering surface that reflects distorted images of the landscape. A single entrance at the base leads into impenetrable darkness.

The sky remains illuminated by the three clustered moons, casting their eerie blue hues over the unsettling scene. The sounds of nature are suddenly silent near the pond, as if all life has recoiled from its presence.

An immense floating hand hovers close to the earth above the barn, wearing a white glove with five fingers extended outwards. Its presence is both mysterious and imposing, casting elongated shadows on the ground below. The white glove appears impervious to the acid's effects but wavers slightly in the strong winds.

Near the pond of blood lie two bright orange scuba suits, retrieved from the ground. The underwater gear is designed to withstand the corrosive effects of the acidic rain and the unknown properties of the dark, viscous blood in the pond. The suits shimmer slightly, their vibrant hue standing out starkly against the grim surroundings.

The expansive field now has an air of heightened tension, with the looming presence of the serial killer Keldryn adding to the already unsettling atmosphere dominated by the pond of blood, the daunting pile of knives inside the jelly cube, and the eerie moons. The small barn stands at the center, weathered and aged, divided by the black metal wall.
